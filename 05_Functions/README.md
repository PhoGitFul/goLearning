Q1. A function should have at least one parameter. True or False?
A1. False there does not need to be any Parameters required in a function.

Q2. In a function, what is the purpose of a return statement?
A2. The return statment is used to terminate the function and optionally return results of the function to where it was called.

Q3. What is the difference between the result(s) list and the parameter(s) list?
A3. The Parameter list is the list of parameters that are passed into the function from the calling code, and the results list is the list of results being returned to the calling code as a result of the function being run.

Q4. Can we write Go programs without functions?
A4. Sure, but this would lead to hard to maintain code if the code was long enoough. Using functions, where suitable, will make the code easier to read and maintain, and allow the re-use of the functions where necessarry, reducing time to change and mistakes if changes to the code are required.  
We can also use functions written by other devs or std functions available in go, which will save us from rewriting the wheel.
Also by using std go functions or those written by other devs, we do not need to see the underlying code, so again will keep our code base less cluttered and easier to read.

Q5. Fill in the blank: 
A5. To launch the execution of a function, I need to call it.

Q6. When I define a function, it will be launched at the beginning of my program. True or False?
A6. False, we need to call the function for it to be executed (run).
